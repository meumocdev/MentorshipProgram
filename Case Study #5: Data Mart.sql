-- üõç B. Data Exploration
-- 1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?
SELECT
  DATENAME(weekday, week_date) AS week_day
FROM clean_weekly_sales;

-- 2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?

-- 3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?
SELECT
  calendar_year,
  SUM(transactions)
FROM clean_weekly_sales;
GROUP BY calendar_year

-- 4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?
SELECT
  DISTINCT region,
  month_number,
  SUM(sales)
FROM clean_weekly_sales;
GROUP BY DISTINCT region,
  month_number
